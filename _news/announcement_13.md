As one of the <a href="/assets/pdf/Meade_Fellowship.pdf" target="_blank">James C. Meade Graduate Fellowship</a> recipients, I had a great opportunity to meet [James C. Meade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IanJ8Mt_BXQ&feature=youtu.be) and his family today. James is such a decent, sharp, knowledgable, and interesting person. He shared his thoughts about engineering, education, future generations, etc. A really respectful man!
